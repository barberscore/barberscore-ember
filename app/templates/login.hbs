        Stuck in a loop?  Click Here.

          Some users have reported getting stuck in a loop where they are redirected to the login page but aren't logged in.  If this happens to you, here is the workaround:
          <ol>
            <li>Click on the login button.</li>
            <li>Enter your email.</li>
            <li>When the email arrives, click the sign in button.</li>
            <li>When you come back to the login page <em>don't click anything!</em></li>
            <li>Bring your mouse pointer to the browser address bar (where the URL is) and hit enter/return.   Sometimes several key presses is necessary for the URL to register.</li>
            <li>Once this URL registers you should then be redirected to your dashboard.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          If this process doesn't work then contact customerservice@barbershop.org and we'll figure out another solution.  Sorry for the trouble and thanks for your patience as we work out these bugs.
