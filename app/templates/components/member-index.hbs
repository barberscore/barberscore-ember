        This is the list of currently active groups for which you are listed as a member. Please access the BHS {{member-center}} and check your group subscription status.
      </p>
      <p>
If the Member Center shows that you are a current member and your group is not listed, check again in 24 hours as your status may not have yet been synchronized. If after 24 hours (and a full browser refresh) your group still isn't listed, please submit an inquiry to report the situation to {{customer-support}}.

      <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Please be patient as <em>newly registered quartets</em> will not be displayed in Barberscore until BHS headquarters has:
