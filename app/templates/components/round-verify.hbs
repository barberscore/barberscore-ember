        Finalizing the Round generates <strong>FINAL</strong> versions of the OSS, SA, Song Titles and Announcements.  They are not made public until the next step, but Finalizing does mean that no further changes will be possible without administrative assistance. Pay particular attenion to the OSS for accuracy and completeness, making manual adjustments in the Appearances, Outcomes, and Draw as necesary <strong>BEFORE YOU VERIFY</strong>.

    <p>
        <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Please take the time to review all the reports thoroughly!  This step can not be undone easily.
