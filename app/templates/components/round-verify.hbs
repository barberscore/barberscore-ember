        This generates draft versions of the OSS, CSA and SA for the CA to verify.  They are not made public until the next step; you will be able to make changes as necessary until the Round is finished.

        <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong>Verifying a Round is a time-consuming process, particuarly on slow networks.  Please be patient!  Allow the process to complete.  If you have waited several minutes and things still aren't working, please refresh and try again.

        Verifying the Round will draw the top <strong>{{model.spots}} multi-round competitors</strong> into the next round and place the Mic Tester at draw 0 (represented by the thick "Cut Line" on the Competitors tab.). Once verified, you'll be able to change the draw manually if necessary.
