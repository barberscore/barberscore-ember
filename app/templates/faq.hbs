<h3><strong><u>Competitor FAQ &ndash; Contest Entry in Barberscore</u></strong></h3>
<br>

<p><strong>I don't see my group in Group Manager &ndash; what is the issue?</strong></p>
<p>Most likely, you have not yet been designated as an &ldquo;admin&rdquo; for your group. Initially (by default), every quartet will have one admin based on the &ldquo;contact person&rdquo; designation in Member Center. Initially (by default), every chorus will have 3 admins defined from the Member Center chapter officer information (President, Secretary, and Treasurer). Additional admins can be designated by an existing group admin via Group Manager in Barberscore. (This process is illustrated in the <em>Competitor Instructions</em> tutorial PDF slides). If this approach is not possible, requests to be designated as a group admin should be submitted to: <a href="mailto:customerservice@barbershop.org">customerservice@barbershop.org</a>.</p>
<p>Another common problem is if you&rsquo;re looking to enter a newly-formed quartet. If so, please refer to the FAQ below: <u>Should I be concerned if I form a new quartet right before the contest entry deadline?</u></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>I can't even login to Barberscore &ndash; what is the issue?</strong></p>
<p>Fortunately, this is now a rare occurrence. Today the most common problems are:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are not using the correct email address associated with your BHS Member Center record.</li>
<li>You have not read the <em>Login Instructions</em> tutorial PDF, and/or you haven&rsquo;t watched the additional short videos explaining how to troubleshoot login issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>If those resources don&rsquo;t help, please request assistance from: <a href="mailto:customerservice@barbershop.org">customerservice@barbershop.org</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Should I be concerned if I form a new quartet right before the contest entry deadline?</strong></p>
<p>YES, (this is a critical issue)! Please be aware that newly registered quartets are not &ldquo;completed&rdquo; (fully registered) in the Member Center until BHS headquarters has: approved their quartet name; collected their subscription fee; and finished the final validation by updating their MC record. <u>This process can take up to 5 business days</u>. Members that may be considering the formation of a new quartet should be getting their quartet registered in Member Center at least one week in advance of their contest entry deadline. Any new quartet failing to comply might still be allowed to compete, but would perhaps not be part of the official &ldquo;draw&rdquo; for singing order appearance and might have to sing first (or last). Please communicate with your DRCJ if you are having a problem or if you are anticipating an issue with this.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>How do I know which awards/contests I should keep as included or should exclude?</strong></p>
<p>Prior to submission, your initial contest entry page will show all of the available awards/contests (for that Contest Session as <strong>Included</strong>. Most quartets and choruses will not however be eligible for every award or contest &ndash; normally just one or two of them. Prior to submitting your entry, you should click the <strong>Exclude</strong> button on those awards for which you are not eligible (or that you don&rsquo;t want to include).</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not sure, contact your DRCJ. You can check with him either before or after you submit your entry. If it is wrong, he can adjust your entry to reflect the appropriate awards/contests for which your group is eligible.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do I have to add all of our songs to our repertory prior to submitting our contest entry?</strong></p>
<p>No. You can add songs to your chart repertory at any time. However, you are reminded that your songs must be added to your repertory prior to singing them on stage. Ideally, we would prefer that this is accomplished no later than one week before the contest, so that we can prepare to properly display the chart information on the Official Scoring Summary (OSS).</p>
<p>Also &ndash; please remember that you are responsible for your charts. By adding the chart, you are declaring and verifying that your group has purchased or has otherwise legally obtained copies of this chart for every member of your group. Any copyright legality issues discovered after you have performed a chart at a contest could possibly lead to a post-contest disqualification.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our quartet has more than 4 songs in our repertory &ndash; do we have to tell you which 4 songs we plan to sing in contest?</strong></p>
<p>No. As long as the songs you do sing are among the list of charts in your repertory, you&rsquo;re good. However, it is a good idea to occasionally remove any extra charts that you will no longer perform in any future contest to minimize the &ldquo;clutter&rdquo; &ndash; but this is certainly not required.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
{{!-- <p><strong>I don&rsquo;t know exactly which members of my chorus will be performing at contest yet &ndash; should I wait until I do to submit our contest entry?</strong></p>
<p>No. Just go through the list and exclude those that you think won&rsquo;t be singing &ndash; then submit your contest entry. Initially, we&rsquo;re just looking for your best guess as to the total number of participants on stage. As you get closer to the contest date, we&rsquo;d like for you to update that list of included and excluded chapter members &ndash; (but no later than the morning of the contest).</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> --}}
{{!-- <p><strong>Why do you need the list of participants on stage for my chorus?</strong></p>
<p>For the International Chorus contest it is required by the Contest &amp; Judging rules. However (for all other contests), it is still a requirement that every performer on stage be a valid, paid member of your chapter &ndash; and everyone has obtained a registration for that District or Division contest. The use of this contest entry information in Barberscore more easily facilitates the job that needs to be done by the DRCJ, chapter secretary, and/or other District officials to verify the names and thus check everyone&rsquo;s status.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> --}}
{{!-- <p><strong>Could my chorus be disqualified if the list of participants on stage is not 100% accurate?</strong></p>
<p>No. The only condition that may lead to a post-contest disqualification, would be if one of your actual chorus performers on stage had an expired BHS membership (at the time of the contest performance), or did not have a convention registration for that contest weekend.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> --}}
<p><strong>How long does it take changes that I make in Member Center to get reflected in Barberscore?</strong></p>
<p>We run a background sync process every 10 minutes. Therefore, any new data (or changed data) in the Member Center should be reflected in Barberscore within 15 minutes. Please remember that data is not refreshed in your browser window automatically in Barberscore. To ensure you&rsquo;re viewing the most recent data, perform an explicit &ldquo;reload&rdquo; or &ldquo;refresh&rdquo; of the web page. If you suspect that a data sync issue has occurred involving member or group info, please submit the query to: <a href="mailto:customerservice@barbershop.org">customerservice@barbershop.org</a>.</p>
<p>However, there is an exception. Please be aware that brand-new quartets are not &ldquo;completed&rdquo; in the Member Center until BHS headquarters has: approved their quartet name; collected their subscription fee; and finished the final validation. <u>This process can take up to 5 business days</u>.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>How do I enter a non-BHS group into a contest session?</strong></p>
<p>Groups other than a chorus that represents a BHS chapter or an officially registered BHS quartet will not be able to enter any contest until they have been added manually via the backend API by a Barberscore Admin. &ldquo;Non-BHS groups&rdquo; include the following: VLQs, Mixed Harmony quartets, Mixed Harmony choruses, Youth quartets, Youth choruses, community or school choirs, and female quartets or choruses (regardless of whether or not they are registered with HI or SAI). If you wish to enter a contest session for score and/or evaluation, the process is the same. Simply gather the following information about your group:</p>
<ul>
<li>The &ldquo;official&rdquo; group name (it does not have to be unique or &ldquo;registered&rdquo; anywhere)</li>
<li>Location (City, State/Province) of the group</li>
<li>Contact person (that will serve as the group admin for contest entry) full name &amp; email. If they are a BHS member or BHS associate, provide their BHS ID number.</li>
<li>Director name (for choruses or choirs). If they are a BHS member or BHS associate, provide their BHS ID number.</li>
<li>For quartets &ndash; the name of each singer and their voice part. If they are a BHS member or BHS associate, provide their BHS ID number.</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip;then email your request (with this information) to have your group added to Barberscore to: <a href="mailto:customerservice@barbershop.org">customerservice@barbershop.org</a></p>
<p>Once we have added the information into Barberscore, the group admin can &ldquo;enter&rdquo; the contest via Group Manager in Barberscore just the same as any other competitor. Of course they should be selecting only the applicable awards (if any) for the group, otherwise it would be for score/eval only.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Does the mic-tester quartet need to "enter" the contest session via Barberscore?</strong></p>
<p>No. However, if any performing quartet or chorus serving as a mic-tester or mic-cooler desires scores from the judging panel (and/or evaluations) &ndash; then they need to &ldquo;enter&rdquo; the contest session via Group Manager in Barberscore just as any other competitor would for score/eval only.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>How do I enter my quartet or chorus into a contest for score/eval only?</strong></p>
<p>All competitors will enter the contest session via Group Manager in Barberscore in the same manner. For those groups that are not eligible for any of the available awards/contests &ndash; (or perhaps they are, but they simply prefer to NOT compete for any award) &ndash; you ensure that you click the <strong>Exclude</strong> button for <u>all</u> awards and contests prior to submitting your entry.</p>
<p>In addition, you will choose to <strong>Keep Score Private</strong>. If that button is selected, it is a signal to the Contest Administrators that you do not want your scores to appear on the Official Scoring Summary (OSS) that is distributed to the public, but instead, you only wish to receive a Contest Scoring Analysis (CSA) sheet instead.</p>
<p>Please note: For any group that is actually competing for one or more awards, selecting the <em>Keep Score Private</em> option will be ignored. Those scores must be included on the OSS.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the process for entering my quartet into another district&rsquo;s International preliminary contest?</strong></p>
<p>Per the official BHS Contest &amp; Judging rules, you must first obtain the appropriate permissions in advance to compete outside of your designated home district. These instructions are available in the <a href="http://www.barbershop.org/files/documents/contestandjudging/C&amp;J%20Handbook.pdf">BHS Contest Rules</a> (Article I.A.4).</p>
<p>Once approved (and once that district&rsquo;s contest session is open for competitor entry) &ndash; go to Group Manager in Barberscore, and select the contest you have been approved to enter (you will see a drop-down list of ALL contest sessions that are open for competitor entry). Of course the only contest award you should select will be the International quartet preliminary contest. You are not eligible to compete for any district level awards. If your quartet scores a 76+, it will be listed along with all of the other quartets in that district that qualified for International.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Can I enter my quartet or chorus into a different division contest within my district?</strong></p>
<p>Normally yes. To be clear, most districts allow for quartets or choruses to enter and compete in a different division contest, however, some require approval in advance, some do not. First, check with your District Representative for Contest and Judging (DRCJ). If it is allowed/approved then you should go to Group Manager in Barberscore, and simply select the contest you wish to enter (you will see a drop-down list of ALL contest sessions that are open for submitting competitor entries &ndash; even those that are in other districts). The rest of the entry process remains the same. However, the only contest awards you should select will be those that involve qualifying for some future District-level contest or award. You may not select to compete for any &ldquo;division-level&rdquo; awards.</p>
